Given CRNs of classes, the program sends an email as well as text message when the classes open
To use:
Change the list "crns" to include the CRNs for which you want to recieve updates
As of 2024, this is what works as email and password:

Go to https://myaccount.google.com/security and make sure 2-step verification in enabled on your account. So for this you can setup an app on your phone like Google Authenticator, authy etc..
Once you have setup "2-Step Verification", from security go to "2-Step verification" again and scroll down to "App Passwords":

Now give your app a name and you will be given a password for your device.
Finally save your password somewhere safe and plugin your email and password into the email_from and email_password variables

To get your phone number in the email format, go to https://www.notepage.net/smtp.htm and check your provider. For example T-Mobile phone numbers can be written as number@tmomail.net
Alternatively, search your provider as email in google to check the SMTP Gateway
Input this as the phone_number_in_email_format variable and run the program
